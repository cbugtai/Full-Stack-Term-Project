## Project General Description

RRC Flea Market is a web platform designed to connect buyers and sellers of
used college materials within a school community. The goal is to make it easier
for students to access affordable resources and for graduates to recoup some of
their expenses. By fostering a circular economy on campus, the platform promotes
sustainability, affordability, and convenience.

### User Stories

- As a new college student, I want to get a good deal on what I need for class,
so I can save money and start strong.

- As a graduate, I want to sell my used class materials that I no longer need,
so I can declutter and earn back some costs.

- As an instructor, I want somewhere I can send my students for cheaper class
materials, so they're better prepared without financial.
